Hero Section: This is the initial landing area where users first arrive. From here, they can choose to sign up or log in.

Authentication Flow: Once users complete the signup or login process, they are automatically redirected to their respective dashboards based on their role.

Role-Based Dashboards: Users will see a dashboard where they can browse services and marketplace products, while providers will see a dashboard that allows them to manage bookings and other tasks.
